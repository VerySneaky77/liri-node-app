# LIRI Bot

### Overview

LIRI provides you with music and movie information based on your written instructions.

### Usage

Type in the command "node ./liri.js [action-request]" to commence the app. An action can be any four of the following commands:
• movie-this [movie title]
• spotify-this-song [music title (optional: artist and/or album)]
• concert-this [band name]
• do-what-it-says

### Note

The command "do-what-it-says" reads a command from an external file named "random.txt". This file must be included within LIRI's root location in order to process this command.
